## Hello, my name is Katherine Sinkler. I have created a resume npm package to print out your resume from your console. 

I have done this by making a directory and running nmp install to be able to publish this as an npm package. Within this directory I created 3 files: readme.md, info.json, and an index.js. I added a filing sytem to my index.js with a path to run this code globally. I also added a path with 3 argument to communicate with the server as to how to respond appropriately to this path if the request from this package will return a result or not.  

In the info.json folder, I placed a template of how your information can be collected as data to build up your resume.
